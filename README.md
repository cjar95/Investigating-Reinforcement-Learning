# Investigating-Reinforcement-Learning
SIT 215 Computational Intelligence: OpenAI Gym Environments Final Project Code

# Environments Used:

Three OpenAI Gym environments were utilised https://www.gymlibrary.ml/

-Taxi V3

-Cart-Pole V1

-Frozen Lake V1


## Included:
-The Taxi Problem python file & jupyter notebook

-The Cart-Pole Problem python file & jupyter notebook

-The Frozen Lake Problem & Temporal Difference python file & jupyter notebook


## Note:
The Taxi Problem python file runs on python 3.9.12

The Cart-Pole Problem, Frozen Lake Problem & Temporal Difference python files run on python 3.7.13

Python 3.7.13 was necessary to use the TensorFlow library. To run both create a new environment following the tutorial below.

**To run python 3.7.13 please follow this tutorial https://www.guru99.com/download-install-tensorflow.html
